SCRIPT: MoveDirectoryScript.ps1
===========================================
AUTHOR: 	Jordana Approvato
DESCRIPTION:	Parses a CSV of file paths and moves each dir and its children to a "To Be Deleted" directory and logs the results in log.csv
REQUIREMENTS:	PowerShell v1.0 or higher, need to edit paths.txt to list the files you wish to move. Optionally, you can change the folder they are moved to by changing the $newPath variable on line 20 (Default "C:/To Be Deleted")
===========================================
STEPS:
===========================================
BEFORE RUNNING
1. 	Open "paths.txt" or create a new file called "paths.txt" if one does not already exist. Make sure that the first line of the text file is "Paths". 
	Fill in each line after that with a path that you want to perform the selected action on. You can include as many paths as you want, but they should ideally be the absolute path (full path).
2.  If you wish to send the folders/files to a directory other than the default ("C:/To Be Deleted"), you can change the $newPath variable on line 20 of MoveDirectoryScript.ps1 to the desired path.
3.	If you wish to start with a clean log file, delete the log.csv file (a new one will be created while the script is running)
===========================================
WHILE RUNNING
1.  Run the PowerShell Script by right clicking the file (MoveDirectoryScript.ps1) and choose 'Run with PowerShell' from the menu, or run the program via the command line if you prefer.
2. 	You will be prompted to select one of the following options:
		[1] Move Entire Folder Structure
		[2] Copy Folder Structure
		[3] Move Files Only, Keep Folder Structure
		[4] Cancel
	Depending on which one you choose, that action will be run on each of the paths provided and all of their subfolders and files.
